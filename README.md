# behrica/polyglot-app

A template to create a polyglot app in Clojure.
It provides a [devcontainer.json](https://containers.dev) configuration which can setup a devcontainer with Clojure, python + R.

It is IDE agnostic, but has some features which ease the devcontainer use from Emacs:
- provides a launchpad config
- it fixes nrepl port to 12345
- configures port forwarding of port 12345
- it installs as well `clojure-lsp` inside the devcontainer. A working `clojure-lsp` in Emacs when connecting to the devcontainer
  requires a certain Emacs clojure-lsp configuration (TODO: details)

This results in being able to do a `cider-connect` to `localhost:12345` when setting up the port forward accordingly.
(which can be further automatised by usage of [devpod](https://devpod.sh/)  

## Usage

FIXME: write usage documentation!

This is a template project for use with [deps-new](https://github.com/seancorfield/deps-new).
It will produce a new library project when run:

    $ clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {net.clojars.behrica/polyglot-app {:git/url "https://github.com/behrica/clj-polyglot-app" :git/sha "8e0260804fefad2e0ac31ca621f5e3d871ae168d"}}}' -Tnew create :template behrica/polyglot-app :name myusername/mycoollib

Assuming you have installed `deps-new` as your `new` "tool" via:

```bash
clojure -Ttools install-latest :lib io.github.seancorfield/deps-new :as new
```

> Note: once the template has been published (to a public git repo), the invocation will be the same, except the `:local/root` dependency will be replaced by a git or Maven-like coordinate.

Run this template project's tests (by default, this just validates your template's `template.edn`
file -- that it is valid EDN and it satisfies the `deps-new` Spec for template files):

    $ clojure -T:build test
